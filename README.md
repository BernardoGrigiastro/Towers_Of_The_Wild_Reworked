# Towers of the Wild: Reworked <!-- omit in toc -->
This mod is based on the popular Forge Mod [Towers of the Wild](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/towers-of-the-wild), 
so all credits go to the original Author [idrae](https://www.curseforge.com/members/idrae_).

We really wanted to use this mod on 1.17+ so we decided to port it.
Because of some other compatibilities we choose the [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) and now, here we are! :)

Have fun using this mod!

This mod adds tall towers in your world, inspired by **The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild**.

This will make your explorations a bit more exciting !

At the top of the tower *(which is purposely not so easy to climb)*, you will find a chest with some loot, as well as a nice view :)

The mod is compatible with every world gen / structure mod and can be configured *(set spawn rate, biome blacklist, etc.)*

Plus, it is also compatible with the [Waystones](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waystones-fabric) mod. If you have both mods installed, a waystone will spawn at the top of each tower! *(this can be changed in the config file)*

This mod does not add any blocks or items to the game (if that matters to you).
